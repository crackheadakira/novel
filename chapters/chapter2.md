CHAPTER 2 - A DISCUSSION WITH GOD
I had just been struck by a fighter plane, but I didn't feel any pain. Instead it felt good, it was the same feeling you get when it's winter and it's really cold outside so you curl up in your futon. I realized that I had been seeing pure white for a few seconds now. It was quite scary to be exact, imagine closing your eyes and instead of seeing pure black you see just your hands and a pure white backdrop.

I myself was a connoisseur of Light Novels so I had read these types of stories before, we categorize those types of stories as Isekai. My ears began to ring, and my body got heavy all of a sudden. It felt like I was falling in slow-motion, then as I hit the ground I landed on a sofa. In front of the sofa was a small little cute table with 4 cups on top of it. When I looked up I saw a female sitting on a big sofa naked. Her breasts were as big as my head, the nipples were as pointy as knives though so I wouldn't really wanna rest in them. I started to move my eyes towards her vagina, but instead of seeing the sweet delight that is a vagina I saw a cock instead. This woman was a futanari.

"Where am I, Heaven?" I said whilst staring at her cock

"No, this run-down place isn't as fancy as heaven, though it isn't as bad as hell either. I guess this place is what you could call 'The Judgement Room'. "

"The Judgement Room? Why do you need a Judgement room, isn't the place we go to decided by our actions?"

"Well you see.. your karma isn't decided by the actions you've done in your lifetime instead it's decided by our judgement. We ask you some questions and you answer them, and after answering those questions we pass a judgement onto you."

"So, people we know as good people could be down in hell?"

"Yes, as a matter of fact there are probably more good people in hell than serial killers."

That racked my brain, then all our actions we've done on Earth never mattered?? How does that make sense.. If people on Earth learned about this fact there probably wouldn't be as much peace as there is right now.

"Now we shall commence the Judgement test."

"Let's see. You were born in the year 20x, that means you'd be in this category. Wait what, why aren't you anywhere in this list!?"

"What do you mean?"

"People of Earth descent should be automatically added to the database, but then that would mean. That'd mean your parents are from there."

"What do my parents have to do with this!?"

"Well you see, they're not actually from Earth. They were originally born in a different universe. That place is so much different from Earth. Technology there isn't as advanced, and to make up for that there is magic but to keep it balanced we also created monsters."

"Because of the fact there isn't a trace of you on the database we're forced to send you to there."

"Wait a second, does that mean I'll be reincarnated or be transferred into an already existing body, because i'd like the latter. As living your life a second time is such a pain in the ass, i'd rather have a body of someone who's 20 years old."

"Well, your wish shall be granted if you don't wish for anything else. You know for your troubles, I'll give you a special type of magic."

"What type of magic?"

"You'll find out."

"That does not sound good at all."

She then stood up and slowly started to walk towards me, with her cock as stiff as a log. She then started to caress my chest, she then slowly leaned towards my ear and whispered.

"Have an enjoyable time."

She then pushed me with her hand that was resting on my chest. I felt that sensation again, that I was falling in slow motion. This time instead of landing in a chair I appeared in the air. I looked down only to see the ground a few hundred kilometers away from me.

I screamt the loudest I've ever screamt that day.

CHAPTER 6 - THE BUILDING
We walked through the door, and my god the building was enormous, it was as if the size of the interior didn't match the exterior at all. I feel like whatever his name was has seen this expression of awe on the face of many generations.

"Hey, what's your name even, you haven't told me yet."

"Oh yeah, sorry I forgot. It's Tibef." Huh, didn't really expect that.

"Magnificent isn't it?" He said with a very smug look

"Y-yeah, this looks more grand than I ever thought it could've been."

I saw a giant golden statue out of the corner of my eye, kind of clich√© if it's the first generation.

"Is that statue the first generation?"

"No, it's actually a statue of the sculptor that made that statue. We don't even know why we keep it up."

Well, that was truly odd, but the statue kind of looks precarious.. but he said it's been up here for sometime so it's fine. Hmm, this giant building looks far too empty for the amount of generations there are.

"Hey, where are all the people in the building?"

"You'll find out one day."

Why didn't he just directly answer my question? Is he hiding something? Before I have any more time to think about it he starts to walk towards a hallway to our right.

We kept walking through the hallway until we hit a dead-end, which was for quite sometime, except this probably isn't a "true" dead-end. As they had a fake dead-end in the prison. I kept waiting for for him to start walking towards the wall and phase through it, but he averted my expectations entirely. He pulled on a lever that opened a hole exactly where we weere standing causing us to fall.

Whilst we were falling many thoughts were racing through my mind such as 'He truly was hiding something, but what?, 'Did I fuck up by following him? Or was there nothing I could do." and "Is he taking me somewhere to die?".

I wanted to yell at him, I tried and I tried, but I just couldn't produce a single sound. It was such a strange feeling, it was the first time ever since I've been on the streets that I've felt like I was truly helpless.

After falling for sometime we finally land with a clear thud, and as soon as I gathered my bearing I put up a half-assed combat stance. He saw it and started chuckling. "Even if I were to try to attack you, you think you could be able to defeat me, even try to injure me? I like you more now, but I honestly can't tell if you're brave or just stupid."

No matter how futile this could turn out to be I won't go down with ease. Even If I have to sacrifice my entire being, I will cause injury.

I ready myself to charge at him but before I've even started to dash towards him he stops my entire body with just his hand on my chest.

"Like I said, no use." The gap between us was even bigger than I thought, if I were to describe it, I am the earth and he's the entire fucking universe, but.. he's only the 482nd generation, how strong could the first generation possibly be??

I yell at him how the gap between us could be this large whilst I was slowly lowering my stance, as I yell that out I realize there are a few people standing in front of us with some of them having their arms crossed. Their expressions looked like they were of acceptance, but I'm also getting a feeling of death around them.

"Not bad rookie, first time anyone's stood up to Tibef."

"Whilst he wasn't that bad, this generation is quite weak if that is all he could do."

"As if you were better, I still remember seeing your pants fully soiled when we saw you first land."

Tibef cut in and told them to quiet down as they've got a tour to give. I asked Tibef what he was talking about, but he just told me to wait and see.

The men in front of us started to chatter between themselves, then one of them clapped their hands. "It's tour time."

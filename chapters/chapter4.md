CHAPTER 4 - THE TRIAL
I sit there in total silence as I wonder why the gods haven't made contact with this world in several millenia, but right now I have more important things to focus on, like my trial. Mr. Honeybuns grabs me by tbe arm and starts bringing me along to a round courtroom. In the middle of the room is a single stand with a spotlight ontop of it. He pushes me forward indicating that I should go there. I slowly walk there as I look around the room, but I can't see anything as it's too dark, all I can hear are whispers. I go stand at the stand and suddenly 3 spotlights show up ahead of me. In walk 3 men and stand on podiums. One of the men swing his arm back and then a loud, yet clear thud can be heard throughout the room. With that bang all the whipsering stops.

"State your name." says the man that had swung the hammer."

"Rak Dilf, 20 years old."

"Do you know the severity of your crime Rak Dilf?"

"No sir. I do not, it was just some fat piggy who happened to be in the way."

"How dare you call the lord of this state a mere 'fat piggy'. His highness ended up getting murdered by you. Now state who you work for, Rak Dilf."

"I work for no-one except myself, earlier I also mentioned to Mr. Honeybuns that I work for the gods as a joke. But how could those 'lowly' gods who haven't contaced us in millenia control me." Just as I muttered those words, I felt a throbbing headache overcome me. As the headache calmed down I heard the goddesses voice within my head, almost as if it was my inner-voice.

"How dare you talk smack about me, I do not care if the residents of this world talk bad about me, but you someone who was transported from another world may not talk bad about me. Do that another time I will strike judgment down on you." That message had left me on my guard with a surprised expression on my face.

The judge then slams down his hammer "Rak Dilf, RESPOND TO ME! Are you ready to accept the consequences for your crime?"

"W-what, I didn't hear what you said. But I'm just gonna assume it was something boring and I'm gonna say yes."

"Now that you are ready to face the consequences for killing the lord of the state you will be executed in 4 lunar days. Until then you'll be kept within your cell and fed the minimum requirement to keep you alive. Guards take him to his cell."

As he said that Mr. Honeybuns came and took me by the hand with some other guard.

"So Mr. Honeybuns, how is the job treating you? Able to find any woman willing to look at your face for a split-second?"

"Why do you keep calling me Mr. Honeybuns?! Call me by my real name Edward sin Carne"

"Mr. Honeybuns sin Carne, I call you honeybuns because you got some fat cheeks down there. Juicier than any honey I've seen on the streets. Oh and well you also look so weak and soft."

I got no response, just a face full of anger. The other guard that had been carrying me by the hand had kept his silence the entire time and just walked along. But I felt like this walk to the cell has taken too long. As it took them just a minute to bring me from the cell to the courtroom before but we've been walking for 5 minutes already. Then suddenly the guard who had been keeping his silence takes out a spade and slams Mr. Honeybuns sin Carne on the back of his head taking him down on the ground quickly. He then releases the grip on me.

"Come on, follow me."

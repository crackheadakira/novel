CHAPTER 3 - MISFORTUNE
As I was falling from the sky at high speeds, I began to see that there was a carriage right under me. My body already became accustomed to the feeling of falling quite fast, i assumed it was a skill granted to me by the god. As I looke down I saw the ground getting worringly closer, so I decide to try to land ontop of this carriage that I see. Just as I was about to hit the carriage, I saw a glince of some fat pig with his head sticking out the window.

I crashed into the carriage with a thundering bang. I felt liquid on my face, I took a drag across my face with my finger and the liquid turned out to be blood, not my blood though. As I looked around me I spotted 2 females and the fat pig I saw before. The women had quite voluptuous breasts, they didn't hold a candle to the goddess though. The piggy was headless, oh and it was not a clean cut at all. The neck stump had big splinters of wood inside them, so I assume the velocity of my impact was enough to crush his head. The guards that had been escorting the carriage now pointed their spears at me.

**"PUT YOUR HANDS UP YOU FILTHY PEASANT!! YOU DARE TOUCH OUR LO-"**

"Let me cut you off there honeybuns, I don't care about what happened here. If you are unable to protect the oh so important piggy, how good of a guard are you even? I bet a cockroach could have done even more."

**"H-H-HOW DARE A LOWLY PEASANT TALK BACK TO ME, SOLDIERS KNOCK THIS MAN OUT"**

A guard opened the door and then came walking in honeybuns with a stern look on his face.

I felt a heavy thump on the back of my head and blacked out. I woke up to the smell of an old man's feet, and do not ask how I know how it smells. I was surprised by how this smell of feet was making me actually quite nostalgic, I had tried exploring every fetish back when I was 1x years old. I thought that no fetish had gotten a reaction out of me back then, but looking back. It seemed like I enjoyed every fetish in existence.

"You are not someone registered in this state, so who do you work for?"

"I *obviously* work for myself, oh and the goddess."

"What did you say, ***THE GODDESS?*** God's haven't made contact with humanity in over 2 millenia, so you are obviously lying because why would they make contact now."

I feel like I said something I shouldn't have.

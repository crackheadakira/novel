CHAPTER 7 - TOUR

The man who had clapped his hands was the first to take the initiative at explaining this place. He had started with the very beginning of this "guild". He kept on talking for quite some time, but to sum it up, the first generation whose name was Quen, had stumbled upon this place entirely by accident. He ended up choosing this spot beacuse of it's isolated location and the giant grassfield near it perfect for building or farming.
But that still didn't explain this underground facility, but just then as if it was perfectly timed 

"Now it's time to start explaining this place. This.. this here is an entirely seperate entity from the building dedicated to training the newcomers. The pace at which you can leave this place all befalls upon you and how you perform."

"Wait, does that mean If i never fully succeed with learning everything, i'll be stuck down here forever, till maybe I kill myself

"Yes, but also no. You see this place isn't a real place, hence the 'seperate entity', it's just a very intricate hypnosis technique. In reality you're just lying on a bed right now, so even if you were to kill yourself you wouldn't die, but your brain would believe it did. But there is still a reason that outweighs all the cons of this place, and that is that we have the ability to control the flow inside of this space."

I didn't know if I was supposed to be impressed by this, as to me this just seemed as some people trying to play god or possibly even some higher creature, but could this also explain why Tibef had felt so strong earlier in the fight? Or was he just that strong. These all were questions I wanted to ask, but Quen had told me to leave the unimportant questions to the end of the tour, and I deemed these unimportant.

"If this is an illusion, does this mean you're not real?"

"Everything here is simultaneously real and fake. It's all built up of objects you've seen somehwere in your life, even if it was from the corner of your eye. All this information stored inside your brain wasn't being used, and the hypnosis magic was able to pull out all that information and make a space that felt familiar and real to just you."

This explanation was quite intricate, but it had a big gap in it's logic. How can I know what Quen or Tibef actually looked like, could I have just been seeing these people as someone else without them even knowing?

"I have a question then.. how can I know what you look like if i've never met you before?"

"Well it's quite simple actually. We've met before, you just didn't notice us, but even so your deeper consciousness did. I was there at your trial, many of us were."

Why hadn't they interferred and why were they just there? These were the very first thoughts I had, but the more I actually thought about it, the more sense it made. They were there to confirm if I was a reincarnatee and they couldn't just intervene without causing more damage than they had done now when they were freeing me.

"As you've probably realized now, we didn't help you, but that was becau-" I cut him off and said 

"You don't have to explain, i've pieced it together in my head."

"I see, we've got a bit of a smart cookie here eh? Since you understand, I don't have to explain the deal between the court, so moving on--" whilst he kept on talking I started to notice a slow but steady increase in his speed of speech. It kept on building up until my brain just couldn't withstand it anymore, when that happened I felt my body and brain seperate, and then my body collapse. He hadn't even noticed, as I just saw him walking towards the endless abyss.. will I be stuck in this state of limbo forever now?
